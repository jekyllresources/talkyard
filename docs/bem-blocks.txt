BEM = Block-Element-Modifier (web-search it, if you don't know what it is).

These short names are (for me at least) more readable than long not-abbreviated names.
You just need to get used to the abbreviations :-) And not forget them. Hence this file.

s_ = some_Whatever (for classes)
t_ = the_Whatever (for ids)
e_ = end-to-end-test_Whatever (classes only, for stuff to click in End-to-End tests)
p_ = public api (classes only, not ids)

s_w-X = wraps an X, i.e., somewhere inside, there's an X. Or "'W'ith a X inside".
w_X   = wraps X. Always a class, not an id.

In-the-middle or at-a-word-end abbreviations: (but not at the start of the selector)
Em = email

Lk = link NO
Ln = link — of course, like `ln -s ...` in Linux.
L  = list
It = list item
D  = dialog,  e.g. AbtUsrD
Dd = deleted
Dl = delete  — change to 'Dt'? 'Dl' looks like Download doesn't it?
Df = draft
Dl = download — change to Dwnl? so rare
CB = checkbox, e.g. s_SthCB
Cb = Contextbar
